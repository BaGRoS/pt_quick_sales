	Last Update: 	20 MAR 2018
	Release Notes:	Restructured Downtrend to allow buy-in of a downtrending 
					pair that shows positive 12h to 3d support.
					
					Enabled "StopProcessWhenTriggered" on all single-market 
					settings.

			
	***THESE SETTINGS ARE BEING TESTED W/ PTM 1.4.0, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK***
	
	***I'm excited about Profit Trailer 2.0. It will have RSI as an indicator
	   which means we can enable trading and use RSI as a buy value for pairs 
	   that are in a downtrend. This will increase the number of buys we can 
	   get into!
	
	***Thought Process Behind Settings***
	1. Reduce risk. I strongly beleive settings are most successful by careful, 
	   thoughtful, and deliberate application of settings that mitigrate risk 
	   and exposure to poorly behaved coin pairs. I, like many of you, get my 
	   knowledge based on seeing consistent results from others. 
	   
	2. Skim the top (credit: YouTube "Crypto Face"). This YouTuber has shown 
	   consistent results trading ETH pairs. He's also shown that using little 
	   capital while aiming to enter and exit pairs as quickly as possible 
	   is a safe and effective method to turn a profit.
	   
	3. Increase trailing where appropriate. Trailing sell is set based on a preceived 
	   likelihood of favorable returns. If I think "this type of situation has great 
	   potential for upside", then the trailing sell is higher. With that, the sell 
	   value might be lower. The lower sell value is an acceptance of higher return 
	   but also acknowledging that things don't always go the way we want them to.
	   
	4. DCA's are good and vary in depth. What I've seen in "bearish or better" markets 
	   so far is that when trading 4 pairs at a time (what I'm doing at the moment), 
	   no more than one pair will enter a DCA4. From there, my assumption is that two 
	   pairs will not go deeper than DCA3 and I'll get lucky with another pair and only
	   hit a DCA2. This is my most likely worst case scenario. Can it be worse? Yes. 
	   Can it be better? Sure! So this assumption, plus my current operating limit of 
	   4 pairs, is what leads me to an ALL_max_cost_percentage of 2.75% in my 
	   PAIRS.properties page. A DCA might tie up your capital, but it'll also increase 
	   your returns with each level of DCA.
	   			
	***Market Trends***
	The trends that I have in place are based on necessity. I identified times where I 
	either missed an opportunity, or suffered a loss due to not capturing a change in 
	a specific time period. One of the things I've noticed is that the most important 
	trends are all within 24 hours. It seems 24 hours and 3 days are strong benchmarks 
	for stability of a pair, so I rely on those to determine what kind of risk 
	a pair presents. The name of the game is to mitigate risk and seize opportunities
	that either present minimal risk and evidence of growth.
	
	***Global Settings***
	Bearish settings are based on a 3 hour anchor. This seems to be a good metric for
	determining overall health of a market. Bullish settings also require an anchor on
	1 hour performance. This is because the bullish settings introduce additional risk,
	so we use an additional metric to ensure the bullish trend is consistent.
	
	***Favorable Single Market Settings (most favorable first)***
	*High Performance*
		The pair has shown a significant amount of growth in nearly all timescales.
		The growth of the pair is such that it would not be appropriate to use EMAGAIN
		since there is such a divergence between the slow and fast EMA lines. In this
		case, we use the LOWBB strategy and look for a pair to dip to half way 
		between the top and bottom bollinger bands. In other words, the value of the pair 
		falls to meet the SMA between the bands. Low trailing buy value is used due to the 
		high performance of these situations. It's not very likely that a dip would 
		continue for long enough to "trail" it. Highest trailing profit of all settings.
	*Dip During 3hr Pump*
		The pair has been performing well but took a bit of a dip. The strength of the
		pair suggests it could make a comeback to its previous value. Else, the
		performance of the pair suggests if it goes into DCA, it won't be for long. 
		Higher railing profit than other settings. Might be getting rid of this, we'll see.
    *Recent Downtrend but 12h to 24h Support*
    	The last 1hr of the pair has shown a dip, but 12hr - 3 day shows positive support. 
    	This might just be a random dip. There might a DCA or two, but again, positive 
    	support shows a recovery from the dip is a possibility. 
	*Well Behaved 3h to 12h*
		The pair has displayed consistent behavior in the midterm. Higher trailing 
		profit than the default setting
	
	***Unvavorable Single Market Settings (least favorable first)
	*New Coin*
		Too much risk. Remove if you want to try to jump on a pump.
	*Downtrend*
		Do not purchase a coin that is showing excessive loss risk in any time period.
		People have commented that downtrend disables a lot of pairs. This is by design.
		Why would I want to invest money in something that has shown nothing but 
		consistently poor results?
	*High Risk Pump*
		These coins are showing very high increases in value. The chance that they
		will crash is too great to risk. If the coin were purchased and DCA enabled,
		it would consume a large majority of capital. If a coin that was purchased and 
		in pairs become a high-risk pump, then we're very likely in the green. This 
		setting will take advantage of that fact. It has a huge sell value and trailing
		profit to ride a coin pair to the peak.
